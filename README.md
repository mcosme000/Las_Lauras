I have started this little project just for practice.
I will try to make a simple webpage for a friend's band.
It will include photos, their bio, music (maybe some playlists and stuff like that)
and some of their products (with a link for their actual online shop).

This is just for practice. I don't have any design in mind. It might change a lot of times!
Also, I don't plan in adding js, for the moment will create a funtional site just with HTML and css!
